        <h3> Life of a Slug</h3>
        <img src="images/slug.webp"></div>
    
    <blockquote cite="Soil Association">life cycle of a slug is made up of three stages: egg laying,
        immaturity and adult. Although slugs can reproduce by themselves it is
        relatively uncommon. Slugs can over-winter at any stage in their life cycle. A
        slug can lay up to 500 eggs a year in batches of 10-50. The gelatinous eggs,
        which are 3-4mm across, are usually laid in crevices in the soil during the
        spring and autumn. In ideal conditions the eggs will hatch within 10 days,
        although hatching may be delayed by as much as 100 days in poor
        conditions, such as cold weather.
        There are 30 different types of slug in the British Isles. However, the four
        which cause the most damage are the grey field slug, the garden slug, the
        keel slug, which can tunnel up to one metre into the soil and causes root
        damage, and the black slug, which is the largest but tends to cause the least
        damage.
        In dry conditions, slug numbers fall where the eggs have become desiccated.
        Although slugs remain inactive in unfavourable conditions, they soon
        become active again in mild, damp weather.</blockquote>
